# datafun-04-notebooks

In this module, we explore the Jupyter environment and notebooks - a web-based approach that combines code with formatted text and automatic display of results.  We'll look at tools for working with one-dimensional and two-dimensional data.  We'll explore the string class and let you know that regular expressions exist to help us identify and parse elements of text (e.g. a phone number or web address). 

At the end of this module students will be able to:

1. Execute Python notebooks in Jupyter (L02)
2. Describe NumPy arrays and how they differ from lists (L02)
3. Describe NumPy (L02)
4. Describe pandas (L02)
5. Create and manipulate pandas one-dimensional Series (L02)
6. Create and manipulate pandas two-dimensional DataFrames (L02)
7. Process text using common string methods (L02)
8. Recognize applications for common regular expressions (regex or re) (L02)
9. Calculate descriptive analytics for one-dimensional and two-dimensional data (L01, L02)
